# Code Quality Rules

## Comments
- Avoid unnecessary comments that explain obvious code
- Remove commented-out debug logs and console statements
- Only add comments for complex business logic or non-obvious decisions
- Keep comments concise and meaningful

## Code Style
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Prefer self-documenting code over comments
- Remove redundant code and unused imports
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## Debugging
- Remove console.log statements from production code
- Use proper error handling instead of console.error for user-facing errors
- Keep debug logs only in development-specific files

## Authentication & Middleware
- Store tokens in both localStorage and cookies for SSR compatibility
- Use middleware for route protection
- Implement proper error handling for auth failures
- Clear tokens on logout and 401 errors

## File Organization
- Keep related functionality together
- Use proper TypeScript types
- Export only what's needed
- Follow Next.js conventions for file structure
